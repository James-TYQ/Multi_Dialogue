In dreams, your silhouette eludes me,  
Amidst the vast expanse of the starry sky, I seek your form.  
Having traversed storms and seen through the swirling dust,  
I remain at a loss, as the path to clarity has vanished.  
It seems I have already lost the pulse of youth,  
A heavy weight presses upon my heart, making it difficult to find peace.  
No one can save me; I refer to this as a mysterious enchantment,  
Only those who have loved before can truly feel the pain of such wounds."",
